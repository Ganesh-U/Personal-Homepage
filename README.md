## üß† Use of Generative AI

### AI Tools Used
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Version 4 Sonnet
- **Usage Period:** February-March 2025
- **Assistance Scope:** Code optimization, design documentation, and debugging support

### Specific AI Assistance
1. **CSS Animation Debugging:** Helped resolve complex positioning issues in the circular menu system and optimized performance for mobile devices
2. **JavaScript Optimization:** Provided suggestions for performance improvements in the skills visualization and responsive design implementation
3. **Documentation Creation:** Assisted with structuring comprehensive README documentation and design document formatting
4. **Code Review:** Helped identify potential improvements in ES6 module organization and best practices implementation

### Prompts Used
- "Help me optimize circular positioning math for the rotating project menu to work consistently across different screen sizes"
- "Review this CSS animation code for better performance on mobile devices and suggest GPU-accelerated alternatives"
- "Create comprehensive documentation structure for an academic portfolio project including all required sections for CS5610"
- "Debug responsive design issues with circular layouts and suggest solutions for maintaining proportions across devices"

### AI Contribution Clarification
All core functionality, creative concepts, and design decisions were developed independently. AI assistance was primarily used for:
- **Debugging and optimization** of existing code implementations
- **Documentation formatting** and structure organization
- **Best practices guidance** for modern web development standards
- **Performance optimization** suggestions for animations and responsive design

The creative interactive elements (skills constellation, circular menu, horizontal timeline) are original implementations developed through personal problem-solving and mathematical reasoning.
